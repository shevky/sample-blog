## Why we use cookies

Cookies help us remember core preferences—your language, theme, and the last article you read—so that every visit feels familiar. We never sell this information or stitch it with advertising identifiers.

## Types of cookies we set

### Essential cookies

These tiny files keep the site functional. They store your locale (`en` or `tr`), selected theme, and consent choices. Blocking them may break navigation or disable translations altogether.

### Analytics cookies

We run privacy-friendly, aggregated analytics to understand which guides resonate most. Metrics such as page views or average reading time steer our editorial roadmap. All data is anonymous and expires within 90 days.

### Functional cookies

Occasionally we cache UI experiments—like a new tag layout—in a cookie so we can roll features out gradually. When an experiment ends, the cookie disappears automatically.

## Managing your preferences

- Use your browser settings to delete or block cookies globally.
- Switch languages or themes from the site header to refresh preference cookies instantly.
- Contact us at [hello@example.com](mailto:hello@example.com) if you would like a full export of your stored preferences.

If you disable cookies entirely, the site will still load, but certain conveniences (saved language, scroll position) will reset every visit.
