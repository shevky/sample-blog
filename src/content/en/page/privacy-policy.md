## What data we collect

- Information you send via the contact form (name, email, and message body).
- Anonymous usage metrics from privacy-friendly analytics.
- Technical data such as IP address and user agent that hosting providers log for security.

We do **not** collect payment data, demographic profiles, or precise location information.

## How we use the data

We use personal data strictly to reply to your questions, troubleshoot bugs, and improve our publishing cadence. Analytics data guides editorial decisions, while infrastructure logs help us detect abuse.

## How we store the data

Content lives in Git, and contact messages reside in our encrypted mailbox. Access is restricted to the two maintainers of Sample Blog. We never share personal data with advertisers or data brokers.

## Your rights

You can request a copy of the personal data we hold, ask us to update incorrect entries, or instruct us to delete everything entirely. Send any request to [hello@example.com](mailto:hello@example.com) using the email address associated with your message so we can verify ownership.

## Updates

We review this policy quarterly. Significant changes appear in the changelog and in release notes when we publish a new version of the site.
